## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Practise for making a request in a React app and passing the data from that request down the chain of components
- Practise using stateless components

A simple React app that displays the current UK top 20 songs. The data for this is here:

https://itunes.apple.com/gb/rss/topsongs/limit=20/json

Requests the data, then displays the list of songs with each song showing its chart position, title and artist.
